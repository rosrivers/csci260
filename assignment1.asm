#The value of the int val is stored in the register $s6. Write a piece of MIPS Q : code that computes and places in the register $s7 the value of 30*val.
#The following conditions should be met:
#the whole answer should be no longer than 10 instructions. only ADD, ADDI, and SUB instructions can be used. Hint: Please think about the following fact “4x + 4x = 8x”.
